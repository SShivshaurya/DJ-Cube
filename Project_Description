Problem Statement
As we know that in previous era we were using
 big analog multiplexers whose main disadvantages are-
High Cost
Difficult to use
Difficult to transport
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Solution
We are here with a cost effective solution through which we want to digitalize the music world.
 It is possible with the use of image processing tools  (Reactivision) and with the help of fiducial markers.
 With the help of these we can easily perform all the   tasks which are previously done by the analog multiplexers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Technology Used
Image Processing Technique is used to detect the marker id which will play the song stored at that location .
 As the camera capture the id a particular song starts and as the id moves from the frame the song automatically stops.
